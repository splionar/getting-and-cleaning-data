## About this project

### Goal

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

### About the dataset

The data in this project represent data collected from the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope from Samsung Galaxy SII smartphone. The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were recorded.
